## Learning Objectives/Competencies (5 Minutes)

1. Provide an introduction to unit testing with JavaScript.
1. Experience Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development first-hand through the use of Mocha and Chai.
1. Practice TDD and BDD concepts via in-class pair challenges.

## Overview / TT (35 Minutes)

### Definitions

> **Test**
> 1. **noun** - a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, especially before it is taken into widespread use.
> 2. **verb** - take measures to check the quality, performance, or reliability of (something), especially before putting it into widespread use or practice.

### TDD and BDD

_Test-Driven Development_ is popular trend in software development. TDD uses software tests as a basis for development.

> _Test-Driven Development_ (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: Requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.

In short, TDD follows this cycle:

1. **Add a Test**: New features are added by first writing a test that fails.
1. **Run All Tests**: Thus validating that the test is working as it should not pass.
1. **Write Code**: Write code that will cause the test to pass.
1. **Run Tests**: If all tests pass, congratulations! You can be confident your code meets the requirements of the test cases. If the tests fail, now's the time to fix them.
1. **Refactor Code**: As the code base grows, it must be cleaned and improved. Tests will help to find problems, errors, or bugs introduced during refactoring.
1. **Repeat**: With each cycle, the functionality of the product, and the reliability/usefulness of the tests, should increase.

TDD offers some advantages. It can increase productivity and help avoid the writing of unnecessary code. It also avoids errors and defects, and lengthy debugging sessions.

* [Wikipedia: Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

TDD does NOT solve all of the your problems for you. Some things are difficult to test, UI interactions for example. **Some tests are difficult to write and evaluate**. Using TDD you might feel you are spending large amounts of time writing tests, code which doesn't go  directly into your finished product.

**For best results, everyone on the team must support TDD, and tests must be carefully planned.**

**It has been suggested that testing first produces better results than writing tests after implementation.**

**BDD** (_Behavior Driven Development_) is an extension of TDD that focuses on communication and collaboration. Imagine putting your tests into words. BDD suggests that names assigned to unit test be whole sentences starting with a conditional verb "should" for example. Taken further, these sentences should describe adding value to the product. For example:

> It displays the a notification when a new post is created.

Some software libraries incorporate BDD into their interfaces. For example:

```javascript
user.should.have.properties("first", "last", "age");
```

You can see this is code but it also is clearly read in english describing important product features. BDD will manifest for us first in libraries like `Expect.js` and `Should.js`. These make assertions in code around BDD syntax like: `should.have.properties()` and `expect().to.be()` or similar.

### Testing with Mocha

The goal of testing is to define software features that the app will have to meet, and test those features to confirm the code works as expected. `Mocha.js` is a testing framework that works with `Node.js`. Mocha **runs tests and displays the results**. Mocha **doesn't** handle assertions. Instead, it **allows you** to **define your own assertions** or **use your favorite library**.

### Defining an Assertion

> **Assertion**
> 1. a confident and forceful statement of fact or belief.
> 1. the action of stating something or exercising authority confidently and forcefully.

In software testing, an `assertion` states what the programmer _expects_, failing when the results do not match the programmed expectation.

### Types of Assertions

#### Should vs Expect

```js
var chai = require('chai')
  , expect = chai.expect
  , should = chai.should();
```

Notice that the `expect` require is just a reference to the `expect` function, whereas with the `should` require, the function is being executed.

* The `expect` interface provides a function as a starting point for chaining your language assertions.
* The `should` interface extends Object.prototype to provide a single getter as the starting point for your language assertions.

### What Should Be Tested

**_Everything!_** (that _can_ be tested)

Okay --- there are things that are difficult to test, which doesn't necessarily mean that you shouldn't test them! Use common sense when defining tests.

If you think of a feature, begin thinking of a test for that feature. **Any function that takes input and provides output can and should be tested!**

### Good vs. Bad Tests

A test should focus on **one** thing. 1 test = 1 feature / code path.

Tests should validate a **unique** feature and not be repeated.

Tests should be short. If you find you are writing a long test case, step back and ask if this case should really be broken down into several smaller tests.

### Final Thoughts Before the Challenges

Writing tests for code _before_ you have the code to test is a great mental exercise. You may find that you will have to write code differently using this perspective. You may find that you write better quality code.

## BREAK (10 Minutes)

## In Class Activity II - TDD Practice (70 Minutes)

Use the [in-class-tdd](in-class-tdd/README.md) project in this repo as a starting point. I recommend [forking this starter repo directly](https://github.com/droxey/tdd-bdd-challenge) to best keep track of your changes.

Feel free to work with a partner.

The goal is to make each test pass!

### Level 1 Challenges

#### Overview

Imagine you just got a job with a MeasureIt.com. They want to create an app that measures everything. You'll need some methods that can return measurements.

* Area should return the area of a rectangle.
* Perimeter should return the perimeter of a rectangle.
* Should return the area of a circle with radius.

You'll start by writing pending tests for these methods. Then write functions that make the tests pass.

### Level 2 Challenges

#### Overview

The product is a shopping cart. The cart will track products added to a cart. The cart needs to add new products, remove products, and provide the total count, and price of all products in the cart.

Start with these test cases and write code to answer test case. Note: there is no code yet that does any of the things the tests ask for.

From a TDD perspective, you start with failing tests and build the  application to meet the requirements of the tests.

In terms of **BDD**, the test descriptions are written to describe what the product should be capable of doing.

```javascript
it('Should create a new item with name and price');
it('Should return an array containing all items in cart');
it('Should add a new item to the shopping cart');
it('Should return the number of items in the cart');
it('Should remove items from cart');

// Stretch challenges
it('Should update the count of items in the cart');
it('Should remove an item when its count is 0');
it('Should return the total cost of all items in the cart');
```

Your goal is to write code that meets the above test cases.

To help visualize the how the cart behaves, you can picture the cart
as a table. Imagine the tables below were drawn up by the design
team to describe how the cart would work.

Imagine your shopping cart is empty:

| name | price | qty | cost |
|------|-------|-----|------|
|      |       |     |      |

Imagine you add an apple to the cart

| name | price | qty | cost |
|------|-------|-----|------|
| apple| 0.99  |  1  | 0.99 |
| total|       |  1  | 0.99 |

What if you add a banana?

| name  | price | qty | cost |
|-------|-------|-----|------|
| apple | 0.99  |  1  | 0.99 |
| banana| 1.29  |  1  | 1.29 |
| total |       |  2  | 2.28 |

What if you add another apple?

| name  | price | qty | cost |
|-------|-------|-----|------|
| apple | 0.99  |  2  | 1.98 |
| banana| 1.29  |  1  | 1.29 |
| total |       |  3  | 3.27 |

#### Hints

 While you won't be making a functional shopping cart, you will have to create some of the system. Think about how shopping carts work. Ask yourself how the cart will keep track of items and what exactly an item is.

"Items" in the cart will be JavaScript Objects, and the "cart" system will hold them in an array.

* Set up your tests run your code. All tests should be pending.
* Solve each test case one at a time by following the TDD pattern.
  * Write functions that handle the test case. The functions should return a value the test case can evaluate.
  * Run your tests. If the first case passes move on to the next, if not revise your code and test again.
* Solving one test case may break a previously working case. In this case refactor and test again.

## After Class
